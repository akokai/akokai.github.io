<h2>Technology, society, and sustainability</h2>
<p>I research social and technical issues in using science and technology to make transitions toward sustainability. By ‘sustainability’ I mean <a href="{% post_url 2015-10-08-sustaining-what %}">a range of ideas</a> connected to long-term human and ecological well-being. I’m interested in how scientific knowledge can be better mobilized to tackle socially complex environmental problems, and how technological sustainability transitions can be brought about in just and participatory ways.</p>

<h3>Knowledge commons for green chemistry</h3>
<p>The central project of my dissertation research investigates patterns of knowledge sharing that are emerging across broad efforts to eliminate toxic chemicals from systems of production. I’m interested in systems of shared knowledge production and management that have the characteristics of <em>knowledge commons</em>, and the ways in which these systems may shape our understanding of chemicals and environmental health. Through this research, I aim to explore ways of collaboratively building information infrastructures for chemical hazard assessment and safer chemical substitution.</p>
