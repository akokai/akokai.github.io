<h1>Research</h1>

<p>My graduate research examined issues in science &amp; technology for sustainability, focusing on materials and production systems.</p>

<h2 id="knowledge-systems">Knowledge systems for material sustainability</h2>

<p>I’m interested in how scientific knowledge can be better mobilized to tackle socially complex environmental problems, and how technological change can be responsible and just. This was the subject of my doctoral research. I asked two broad questions having to do with green chemistry as an approach to eliminate toxic substances from systems of production.</p>

<p>What kinds of systems could produce, test, verify, and organize scientific knowledge in ways that better meet the needs of a growing community of green design practitioners, advocates, and decision-makers? I investigated emerging systems of collective knowledge production and management—<em>knowledge commons</em>—as a potential way to improve our understanding of chemicals and environmental health.</p>

<p>How can green chemistry and sustainable design solve socially-complex problems when the dominant societal tendency is to “sleepwalk” through technological changes? I argue that society should be actively and consciously involved in shaping alternative material technologies. But what would it take to recruit pluralistic and democratic participation in technological development? How could processes of green design be reshaped?</p>
