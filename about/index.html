<h2>What I do</h2>

<p>I work on mobilizing knowledge for decision-making about sustainable production. I currently support product life cycle analysis and supply chain environmental analysis at <a href="https://www.apple.com/environment/">Apple</a>.</p>

<p>I’m a graduate of UC Berkeley’s Department of <a href="https://ourenvironment.berkeley.edu/">Environmental Science, Policy &amp; Management</a>, where I worked with <a href="https://ourenvironment.berkeley.edu/people/alastair-t-iles">Alastair Iles</a>. While there, I helped teach courses in the <a href="https://bcgc.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley Center for Green Chemistry</a> and did participatory research with the Healthy Building Network focusing on their chemical hazard data system, <a href="https://pharosproject.net/">Pharos</a>. Earlier, I did research in green chemistry and chemicals policy at UC Berkeley’s <a href="https://coeh.berkeley.edu">Center for Occupational and Environmental Health</a>. And before that, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/jo062401o">organic</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10610278.2015.1122196">organometallic &amp; supramolecular</a> chemistry.</p>

<p>I really enjoy <a href="https://akoskokai.bandcamp.com/">making music</a>, cycling, gardening, and <a href="https://eastbaymeditation.org">meditation</a>. <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/faq/">▸▸</a></p>
