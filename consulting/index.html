<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>

<p>Through my consulting services I aim to <b>build knowledge infrastructure for sustainable production,</b> focusing on green chemistry and material issues.</p>

<h2>What I do</h2>
<p>I help organizations design and adopt new approaches, systems, policies, and technologies to protect the environment and health. I also help organizations develop tools and information systems to mobilize knowledge—to inform decisions, and to understand, visualize, and communicate impacts.</p>

<h2>How I work</h2>
<p>My work is rooted in a strong interdisciplinary research background including chemistry, environmental, and social sciences. I combine systems thinking with technical know-how. My specialties include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>integrative research</li>
    <li>policy analysis &amp; development</li>
    <li>data analysis &amp; visualization</li>
    <li>software &amp; information systems design</li>
    <li>technical writing</li>
</ul>
