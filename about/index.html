<h2>What I do</h2>
<p>I’m a doctoral candidate in UC Berkeley’s department of <a href="https://ourenvironment.berkeley.edu/">Environmental Science, Policy &amp; Management</a>. While at the university, I’ve helped teach courses in the <a href="https://bcgc.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley Center for Green Chemistry</a> [<a href="https://bcgc.berkeley.edu/Green%20Chemistry%3A%20An%20Interdisciplinary%20Approach%20to%20Sustainability%20%20">1</a>, <a href="https://bcgc.berkeley.edu/engineering-and-health-impact-methods-green-design">2</a>, <a href="https://bcgc.berkeley.edu/greener-solutions/">3</a>] and have been a fellow in the <a href="http://sage-bcgc.berkeley.edu/">NSF Systems Approach to Green Energy</a> program.</p> 

<p>I have worked with NGOs and companies to mobilize knowledge for decision-making about chemical and material sustainability. I participated in developing the Chemical Hazard Data Commons, a project that is now part of the Healthy Building Network’s <a href="https://pharosproject.net/">Pharos</a>. I helped Apple develop a framework for <a href="https://www.apple.com/environment/pdf/Apple_Prioritizing_Chemicals_2018.pdf">prioritizing chemicals of concern</a> in the electronics industry.</p>

<p>Earlier, I did research in green chemistry and chemicals policy at UC Berkeley’s <a href="https://coeh.berkeley.edu">Center for Occupational and Environmental Health</a>. My prior academic background is in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/jo062401o">organic</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10610278.2015.1122196">organometallic &amp; supramolecular</a> chemistry. I also really enjoy music and growing plants. <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/faq/">▸▸</a></p>
