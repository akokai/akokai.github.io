<h2>What I do</h2>
<p>I’m a doctoral candidate in UC Berkeley’s department of <a href="http://ourenvironment.berkeley.edu/">Environmental Science, Policy &amp; Management</a>, and a fellow in the <a href="http://sage-bcgc.berkeley.edu/">NSF Systems Approach to Green Energy</a> program. I participate in developing the <a href="https://commons.healthymaterials.net/">Chemical Hazard Data Commons</a>, an exciting collaborative project that I’ve been involved with from the start. I have co-taught courses at the <a href="http://bcgc.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley Center for Green Chemistry</a> [<a href="http://bcgc.berkeley.edu/Green%20Chemistry%3A%20An%20Interdisciplinary%20Approach%20to%20Sustainability%20%20">1</a>, <a href="http://bcgc.berkeley.edu/engineering-and-health-impact-methods-green-design">2</a>, <a href="https://bcgc.berkeley.edu/greener-solutions/">3</a>] and have taught Python programming workshops at <a href="http://dlab.berkeley.edu/">D-Lab</a>.</p>

<p>I’ve previously done research at the UC Berkeley School of Public Health, <a href="http://coeh.berkeley.edu/greenchemistry/">Program in Green Chemistry and Chemicals Policy</a>. My prior academic background is in <a href="http://doi.org/10.1021/jo062401o">organic</a>, <a href="http://doi.org/10.1080/10610278.2015.1122196">organometallic &amp; supramolecular</a> chemistry. I enjoy making electronic music, growing plants, tinkering with computers, and reading.</p>

<h2>Why</h2>
<p>I’m committed to using science &amp; technology among diverse approaches to build a sustainable and just society.</p>
