<h2>Technology, society, and sustainability</h2>
<p>I research issues in science &amp; technology for sustainability, focusing on sustainable materials and production systems. Iâ€™m interested in how scientific knowledge can be better mobilized to tackle socially complex environmental problems, and how technological change can take place in just and participatory ways.</p>

<h3>Knowledge commons for green chemistry</h3>
<p>The central project of my dissertation research investigates patterns of knowledge sharing that are emerging across broad efforts to eliminate toxic chemicals from systems of production. I investigate systems of shared knowledge production and management that have the characteristics of <em>knowledge commons</em>, and the ways in which these systems may shape our understanding of chemicals and environmental health. Through this research, I aim to explore new ways of collaboratively building information infrastructures for chemical hazard assessment and safer chemical substitution.</p>
