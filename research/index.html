<h2>Technology, society, and sustainability</h2>
<p>I research issues in science &amp; technology for sustainability, focusing on sustainable materials and production systems. I’m interested in how scientific knowledge can be better mobilized to tackle socially complex environmental problems, and how technological change can take place in just and participatory ways.</p>

<h3>Knowledge commons for green chemistry</h3>
<p>The central project of my dissertation research investigates patterns of knowledge sharing that are emerging across broad efforts to eliminate toxic chemicals from systems of production. I investigate systems of shared knowledge production and management that have the characteristics of <em>knowledge commons</em>, and the ways in which these systems may shape our understanding of chemicals and environmental health. Through this research, I aim to explore new ways of collaboratively building information infrastructures for chemical hazard assessment and safer chemical substitution.</p>
