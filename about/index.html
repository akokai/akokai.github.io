<h2>What I do</h2>

<p>I work on advancing the use of safer chemicals and materials in electronics manufacturing, together with my colleagues at <a href="https://www.apple.com/supply-chain/">Apple</a> and our network of partners. I’ve also developed data systems to support product life cycle analysis at Apple.</p>

<p>I’m a graduate of UC Berkeley’s Department of <a href="https://ourenvironment.berkeley.edu/">Environmental Science, Policy &amp; Management</a>, where I worked with <a href="https://ourenvironment.berkeley.edu/people/alastair-t-iles">Alastair Iles</a>. While there, I helped teach courses in the <a href="https://bcgc.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley Center for Green Chemistry</a> and did participatory research with the Healthy Building Network focusing on their chemical hazard data system, <a href="https://pharosproject.net/">Pharos</a>. Earlier, I did research in green chemistry and chemicals policy at UC Berkeley’s <a href="https://coeh.berkeley.edu">Center for Occupational and Environmental Health</a>. And before that, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/jo062401o">organic</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10610278.2015.1122196">organometallic &amp; supramolecular</a> chemistry.</p>
